today I'm:

brainstorming and planning for how to frame my research in a public sphere - it's highlighting where I need to do some work in clarifying thought/ writing

what feels (reasonably) ready to share with the world is the PhD-Live platform and what it is trying to signal and bring to life about the learning process. I can talk about future plans and additions to the platform that I am to do. Particularly around targeted and specific implementations of LLM's alongside my research tracking. 

additionally the teaching bots work is also becoming more developed, but until ethics have been cleared not sure how much I can effectively talk about with this.

get clear about what the adjacent and relevant works are to PhD-Live
