what feels (reasonably) ready to share with the world is the [[PhD-Live]] platform and what it is trying to signal and bring to life about the learning process. I can talk about future plans and additions to the platform that I am to do. Particularly around targeted and specific implementations of LLM's alongside my research tracking. 

what I do need to do very soon, is get clear about what the adjacent and relevant works are to PhD-Live, and to situate this work (this is been happening in the background, but haven't put aside time to flesh this out)

additionally the [[teaching-bots]] work is also becoming more developed, but until ethics have been cleared not sure how much I can effectively talk about with this.
