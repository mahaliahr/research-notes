### Things we discussed in the last meeting: 
- put time aside for contextualising/positioning work (writing)

two reflections - 
- my motivation 
- focus on process 

### Highlight key readings and sources that I have been looking at:

[[smith-nunes-offline-llms-and-the-future-private-AI]]

[[hao-empire-of-AI-2025]]

[[blackwell-et-al-2022-live-coding-user-manual]]

share working progress of glossary of terms [[glossary-index]]


### Things that I have been doing 

- building the [[PhD-Live]] site
- [[thesis-bot]] collaboration on the MSc (might be good to do a supervisor bot and thesis bot side by side of features and differences? )
- AI Literacy Classes + Resources (teaching activity feeding into the research)
