### Things that I have been doing 

- building the [PhD-Live](https://phd.mm-hr.com/) website
	- reflection and rationale behind this here: [[focus-on-process]]
- [[thesis-bot]] project collaboration on the MSc Creative Computing <!--  (might be good to do a supervisor bot and thesis bot side by side of features and differences? ) -->
- AI Literacy Classes + Resources (teaching activity feeding into the research) https://git.arts.ac.uk/mhenryrichards/AI-Literacy-Introduction
- Supervisor Bot Ethics Form Complete - [AI supervisor bot](https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/m_henryrichards_arts_ac_uk/IgCGmsEngK2HT4CGpRTzBlz8AXp2rVJv_e7r1NEEqnLibwg?e=CqGTWp)

Discussion points:

- Although I have made progress, I have struggled to find time to work on the PhD as much as I would have liked. Timelines of projects have been pushed. I am now planning to do staff interviews in the new year
