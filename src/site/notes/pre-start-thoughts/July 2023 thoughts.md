REMEMBER - You can do all the things you want to do without a PhD

---

PhD as activism 

Critical and provocative work

--- 

Working within constraints (me)

---

Personal - why do I feel like I need to do this? Bring this reality explicitly into the research

---  

ChatGPT as additional supervisor - a project for the research

---

PhD process is a critical object? Reflecting on the trajectory of education whilst pursuing an educational milestone
