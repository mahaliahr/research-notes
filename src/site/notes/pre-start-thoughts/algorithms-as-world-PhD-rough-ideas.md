order - resistance - messiness

The current state of the world - systems 
[[types-of-systems]]
specific case study education -> creative computing
(which system? education)

(playing with(in) the system to build something new)

what is worlding?

Use the idea of algorithms as a framework to work within 
ML algorithms 
Generative algorithms
[[algorithms-as-framework]]

(rigidity as canvas)

methodology ?
play as methodology - too vague?
improvisation and imagination 

experience design

collaborative world building using computational tools?

metaphorical and literal

making the familiar strange

systems as stories / embodying it as a way to learn
