#### Daily Log

- 16:46 today doing some work and brainstorming towards possible conferences I can contribute too
- 16:49 this thinking is leading me to think about [[my-practice]] and being more clear (for myself) how my practice past and present feeds into my research -- particularly around spatial/experience design and how this might feed into the research, maybe contributing to more clearly defining what I see as [[possibility-spaces-and-impossibility-spaces]]
	- note to self this will be another thing to include in my [[writing-plan]]
- 17:48 idea -> learning dashboard. I have this fairly unformed idea right now of creating a dashboard that can connect to the [[PhD-Live]] system (ie.obsidian) and also to [[project-supervisor-bot]]
