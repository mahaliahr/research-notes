- 19:47 just deployed the PhD-Live site. Pleased that I've done that, took more time than I wanted, but now it's done I can refocus back on all the other research tasks that I have to do. I also need to probably strengthen the functionality and logic of the site and be able to communicate things in a clearer way
- 19:50 I need to check the planning gantt chart, as to what the priorities are, but ethics is important
