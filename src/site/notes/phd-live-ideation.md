early thoughts:

As mentioned in [[focus-on-process]] live coding was an inspiration for this idea of showcasing the emergin nature of the PhD

my initial idea is to create a central hub of major workspaces that I am generating work on - github, obsidian, notion, youtube(?). 

I am also curious about leaning more into the liveness and perhaps doing broadcasts (livestreams) or something? Need further thought about what that would actually be, but I am really interested in exploring this.

currently the platform has two 'layers' the note layer and the live layer. I would like to incorporate a third layer being the AI layer - this is where I would implement specific LLM tools tools within the process. 

high level thoughts at the moment are, what would it be like to have the LLM synthesising and perhaps finding different meanings to myself in the process, and how can I surface its contributions in a clear way ?
