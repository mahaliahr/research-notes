early thoughts:

As mentioned in [[focus-on-process]] live coding was an inspiration for this idea of showcasing the emergin nature of the PhD

my initial idea is to create a central hub of major workspaces that I am generating work on - github, obsidian, notion, youtube(?). 

I am also curious about leaning more into the liveness and perhaps doing broadcasts (livestreams) or something? Need further thought about what that would actually be, but I am really interested in exploring this.
