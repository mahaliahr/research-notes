short description of the project so far: 

This project is a collaboration within our course. we are building a specialised LLM that is prompted and trained to have specific knowledge of the thesis process. The hope is that students are able to use this as the first call for questions about deadlines, expectations etc. Also as a way to help them through their ideation phases all the way through to structuring research and writing their paper.

We have a prototype working that supports this and running parallel with have another chatbot interface that has been trained on the marking criteria for the unit and can give very specific guidance and feedback to students on how they are adhering to the unit guidance.

in order to refine the project further, we would need to conduct user testing from our students.
