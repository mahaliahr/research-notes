### **2) Impact on thinking and learning**

- Did working with the bot change how you approached your research or creative process? If so, how?
- Did it help you clarify your ideas, or did it ever feel like it steered you in unhelpful directions?

- Did you ever feel the bot was taking too much control, or did it mostly feel supportive?
- What made you feel in control when working with it?

### **4) Comparison with human supervision**

- What could the bot do that humans couldn’t, and vice versa?
- Are there things you would want to keep strictly human in supervision?

### **5) Trust and boundaries**
