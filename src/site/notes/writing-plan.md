- focus on progress note, make into a fully fledged post - exploring more deeply my motivations behind this all -> [[focus-on-process]]
- a post looking at historic 'vintage' bots, what can we learn from what has already been achieved. Have we reached the limit of what the chatbot interface is good for
- exploring my personal vantage point on all this, my positionality and get clearer on how I hope to employ an autoethnographic practice within this research -> [[my-positionality]]
- reflection on supervisor bot v1 prototype
- explore existing educational models and making the case that phd learning is more in common with early learning in schools than we might imagine(?)
