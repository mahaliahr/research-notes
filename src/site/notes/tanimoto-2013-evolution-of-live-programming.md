in this paper Tanimoto revisits his earlier definitions of liveness in programme to acknowledge critiques and extend the definition to include new liveness behaviours afforded by developments in machine learning. 

the granularity in which this paper breaks down liveness in programming is useful to make comparisions to, in my builidning of a live research platform and how I position and define the liveness in clear ways.

I am particularly intrigued and think this could open up interesting avenues to explore around his extended definition 5. tactically predictive and 6. strategically predictive. In which he talks of programming environments having the ability to plan ahead and create new versions of software based on the current program and a wider knowledge base. This behaviour he talks of is very aligned with functionality that LLMs / agents are doing right now. He speaks crucially of **agency** being the key differentiator of 5 and 6 to the rest of the hierarchy
