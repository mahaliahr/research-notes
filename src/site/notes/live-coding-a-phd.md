## WIP title: Livecoding a PhD - 'PhD-Live' as an artistic-research experiment

what does it mean to make learning and research a live and performative act /

exploring liveness and performativity of research (and learning)

---
#### the 'problem' / the provocation

there are wild claims that commercial AI systems have knowledge at PhD level (amongst others ) this completely takes away and flattens what is arguable the most important aspect of learning which is the journey

#### the impact of liveness/performativity on learning/research

ways to possible frame the 'live' exploration

- **temporal**: work is published as it happens,
- **performative**: thinking is enacted, not polished,
- **relational**: audiences may witness, respond, or influence,
- **computational**: systems update, regenerate, recombine.

something so far unexplored , but worth thinking about is the impact of an audience on the work, if research and learning is performed - how might this shape the research and how can I enable or facilitate this more concretely

liveness affecting the research, in an over thinking and reshaping of the process? like social media orginally being about authentically sharing, but then that act of openness and transparency actually then became considereed and performative as people think about how/ what they post might be percieved or understood. this kind of mentality could easily become of a practice such as this 

#### potential structure: 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intro - the provocation</mark>

- the problem of outcome-driven scholarship,
- the rise of generative AI,
- and your core question:
    > what if a PhD could be livecoded?

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">phd-live as artistic work</mark>

Describe:
- what PhD-Live is,
- how it functions,
- how it is used in your research practice.

Focus on:
- design decisions,
- aesthetics,
- temporality,
- and intentional constraints.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">liveness, process and computation</mark>

Situate the work conceptually:

- livecoding as a research metaphor
- process as knowledge
- computation as a medium for thinking -- ?

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">AI, authorship and research culture</mark>
reflect on
- how AI is reshaping academic work
- why process becomes politically and epistemically important 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The School of X as a live experiment</mark>
- what I want to develop next
- questions I want to explore
- how the school will shape the project/research
