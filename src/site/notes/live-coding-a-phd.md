Livecoding a PhD - 'PhD-Live' as an artistic-research experiment

what does it mean to make learning and research a live and performative act 

---

there are wild claims that commercial AI systems have knowledge at PhD level (amongst others ) this completely takes away and flattens what is arguable the most important aspect of learning which is the journey

ways to possible frame the 'live' exploration

- **temporal**: work is published as it happens,
- **performative**: thinking is enacted, not polished,
- **relational**: audiences may witness, respond, or influence,
- **computational**: systems update, regenerate, recombine.

something so far unexplored , but worth thinking about is the impact of an audience on the work, if research and learning is performed - how might this shape the research and how can I enable or facilitate this more concretely
