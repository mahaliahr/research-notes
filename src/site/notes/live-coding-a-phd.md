## WIP title: Livecoding a PhD - 'PhD-Live' as an artistic-research experiment

what does it mean to make learning and research a live and performative act /

exploring liveness and performativity of research (and learning)

---
#### the 'problem' / the provocation

there are wild claims that commercial AI systems have knowledge at PhD level (amongst others ) this completely takes away and flattens what is arguable the most important aspect of learning which is the journey

#### the impact of liveness/performativity on learning/research

ways to possible frame the 'live' exploration

- **temporal**: work is published as it happens,
- **performative**: thinking is enacted, not polished,
- **relational**: audiences may witness, respond, or influence,
- **computational**: systems update, regenerate, recombine.

something so far unexplored , but worth thinking about is the impact of an audience on the work, if research and learning is performed - how might this shape the research and how can I enable or facilitate this more concretely

liveness affecting the research, in an over thinking and reshaping of the process? like social media orginally being about authentically sharing, but then that act of openness and transparency actually then became considereed and performative as people think about how/ what they post might be percieved or understood. this kind of mentality could easily become of a practice such as this 

#### potential structure: 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intro - the provocation</mark>

- the problem of outcome-driven scholarship,
- the rise of generative AI,
	- speculative practice to explore/tackle the problem
- and your core question:
    > what if a PhD could be livecoded?
    
an experiment in transparency, temporality and process. 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">phd-live as artistic work</mark>

Describe:
- what PhD-Live is,
- how it functions,
- how it is used in your research practice.

Focus on:
- ~~design decisions,
- ~~aesthetics,
- temporality,
- and intentional constraints.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">liveness, process and computation</mark>

Situate the work conceptually:

- livecoding as a research metaphor
- process as knowledge
- computation as a medium for thinking -- ?

what does liveness mean (to me) in this context
openess (broadcast + sharing)
performativity (is this performative, can it be - is there a use for this in the process) is this a performance? maybe that is bad

incremental and exponential growth of work and thinking

to capture process, is not iself novel, but through computation and through the use of LLM tools, I'm interested in more than just the process we consciously measure and record. this system hope to capture more by being the main intemediary material in which I work and thus capture more of the liveness of this experience.

liveness generates by the AI layer (aliveness? emergent behaviour beyond my direct thinking)

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">AI, authorship and research culture</mark>
reflect on
- how AI is reshaping academic work
- why process becomes politically and epistemically important 

making tangible the labour and effort involved in creation

how does the introduction of LLM tools into the work process shape thinking and process

- what I want to develop next
- questions I want to explore
- how the school will shape the project/research
