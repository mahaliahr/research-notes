### What it is

- PhD-Live is a public showcasing of my doctoral research - an ongoing, transparent performance of thought.
- It’s part website, part studio, part sketchbook
- A place where thinking comes together, connections emerge, and the process itself becomes the work.
---
### How it works

The website supports live tracking, session logging, and real-time reflections of my work as the research develops.

The site is organised around three kinds of notes:

- **Daily notes** - where most thinking happens: quick ideas, questions, experiments, and reflections.
- **General notes** - short, focused notes that capture a single idea and link to related notes, forming a network of connected thoughts rather than a linear notebook. (This approach is inspired by the [[zettelkasten]] method, a way of thinking through writing by building connections between ideas over time).
- **Posts** - more developed pieces of writing, often shaped from earlier notes.

These feed into the homepage that continuously updates to show:

- What I am working on live or today.
- My most recent reflections.
- A visual graph of how ideas connect across the project.

 Unlike a traditional blog, this site does not present finished work, but instead showcases a ecosystem of evolving thoughts and ideas.
 
**This site is a constant work in progress.**

### How it's built

[PhD-Live](https://github.com/mahaliahr/phd-live) is built from my evolving collection of notes, managed locally in Obsidian and published as a living website. [^1]

[^1]: _The system is based on an adapted version of the open-source [Digital Garden Eleventy](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) framework - which transforms a folder of Markdown notes into a browsable, interlinked network of ideas._

### Why it exists

This website forms part of my practice-based PhD at the Creative Computing Institute, UAL.

My research explores how generative AI is transforming learning and teaching and uses speculative design and imagination as a method to create new ways to engage with these systems. 

By designing this platform, I am exploring what it means to make research processes visible. Inspired by my practice as a live coder, I was wondering what it might look like if you could "live code" a PhD. I believe in this new era of learning, which is greatly shifted by the impacts of generative AI - **process becomes everything**.

This site therefore functions both as a tool and as a case study within my broader inquiry.

<!-- Rather than presenting a polished outcome, [[PhD-Live]] foregrounds the process of becoming
- how ideas unfold, cross-pollinate, and sometimes fall apart.
- capturing the learning process as archive and performance - an experimental rehearsal for what scholarship might look like when it becomes live, networked, and entangled with AI. -->
