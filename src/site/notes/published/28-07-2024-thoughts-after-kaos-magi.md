This is a random side note, but in a way it feels worth mentioning. My current obsession with making music (algorithmically) obviously connects to my music background (orchestra + French Horn) but also is a way of expressing lots of feeling (in combination with visuals also). I believe that this is, in a way a sense world-building - I want to channel some of this joy and obsession into the 'art' ([[my-practice]]) of the PhD. I don't want the research of it to strangle the fun, play and exploration. 

Also after a conversation I had a Kaos Magi yesterday discussing my research, I realised that I need more knowledge about the technical capabilities of the genAI in my context, specifically it's limits[^1].
