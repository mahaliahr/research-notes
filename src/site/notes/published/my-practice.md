(20-08-24) I am thinking a lot currently about what exactly my practice is. I have an interdisciplinary design practice, which started (in studying in HE) in the realm of Architecture, this spatial/experience design approach for sure has a relevance and underpinning to my work now, but not in an obvious way. 

Performance is also something important to me creatively although I have not pursued any of this 'professionally' but this bleeds into the work that I am creating and underlies some of the ways that my thoughts are developing in regards to play and imagination.
