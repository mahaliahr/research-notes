I have noticed there seems to be a lot of panic and/or exasperation at students use of AI and [[complaints-about-LLM-use]]. With a lot of focus on trying to see if the student used it and 'catch them out'. This seems to me the wrong way to approach it, but the use of AI is very much changing the learning process so it does need to be addressed in some way. 

Often students may be using AI even before they are enrolled, specifically in regards to the application and admissions step ([[LLMs disrupting formalities]]).

I think that it is important to consider why so many students might be using AI, as I don't think it's because they want to 'cheat' or take the 'easy route'. Understanding these bigger reasons may help us to think of suitable approaches moving forward. Additionally having the skills to engage with AI tools is increasingly being seen as a skillset that is worth developing - so how to balance building these skills vs. the negative impact that this might have on students learning experience?
