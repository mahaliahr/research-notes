should people be allowed to opt out of using [[generative-AI]] in learning

in theory yes, but what would that mean?
what would be the motivations for someone wanting to opt out 

in the podcast [[ibm-2024-AI-in-education]] a few reasons were mention that might encourage someone to optout
- people just generally scared of the technology 
- privacy risks 
- risk of echo chamber and bias that an AI model might subject someone to 

all these reasons boil down to a lack of trust - which is a **sociotechnical problem** not a tech problem. Fundamentally there needs to be accountability to meet with this trust issue that is iincredibly important.
