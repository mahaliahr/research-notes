I believe I need to research more about research methods in education and non-coventional artistic research methods.

---

For my [[published/pgcert-final-project\|pgcert-final-project]] I began to explore [[published/Autoethnography\|autoethnography]] and I would like to investigate in more depth the expressive capabilities of this - can they be visual for example? 

The process of recording my [[autoethnographic-experience-as-lecturer-and-student]] needs to be captured somehow - [[field-notes]] is a way to do this (I need to do more research on this).

I need to consider how the research methods feed in the broader 'playful' [[methodology]]

Additionally I want to work with the cohort that I teach, inviting students to be a part of the research in a participatory way, I will need to look more into [[participatory-research]]
