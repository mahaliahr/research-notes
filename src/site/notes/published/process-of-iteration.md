'research in art and design is characterised by iteration' p13
Each new cycle of actions is based on the findings of the previous one.  Your questions, knowledge and practice move forward by looking back and responding to what has happened

iteration is particularly important in research by making. Applying what you've learnt from one cycle to the next will help you refine your questions and show where the deadends are. the cyclical movement provides a structure for reflection and deliberation
