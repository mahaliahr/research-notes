I am having thoughts around how to build this and I am thinking of it being some kind of 'customisable entity' using [[generative-AI]] specifically [[large-language-models]] to create this personalizable interface. The user has agency in building the supervisor and the characteristics that it has. In this sense it will be very personal to the user and due to them customising it, they will (need to) have a level of understanding about it, which will hopefully lead to a more informed utilisation.

I think that I need to do more work with Supervisor Bot before I am ready for this project to happen. 

I have a feeling that I want this not to be a LLM interface, like LLM chatbots, but something different. I am very interested in physical objects that might be able to feed into larger systems like a LLM interface. I would like it to be different to the status quo of a chatbot interface, what other kinds of interactions could be useful in a learning context. 

A kind or guardian/assistant that offers something different to the educational experience. 

I can develop further what that actually is through Supervisor Bot iterations and developments.

Maybe I can do an ideation workshop about what this might look like?

what are the key objectives that I want to achieve through this project?

- physical intermediary devices that can assist in the process of learning or delivering work

What do I hope people might learn?
