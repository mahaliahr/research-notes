Meeting Notes: 

Annual report - needs to be done **before** October 1st

add ethics form to folder

need to do some contextual writing, for the bot

supervisor bot
 -> DIY bot with students[^1] (see what their background is)
	 contrast to Chatgpt
	 educational tool as a way to understand
climate crisis impact

demographic of student cohort, conspiracy about international students and AI and stricter policies not being in place because of this.

start being clear about glossary and key terms

pedagogies of care 
[^1] it's political to give the student the tool to create these things themselves 

speak about the challenges of doing insider research and balancing the teacher and researcher roles and how it impact the PhD research

approach Femi about AI board

Ruth Powell - has been involved in writing AI policies for the university

Wesley Goatley

questionnaire helps to shape the interview that I will have - triangulation

blocking out time for contextualising and positioning alongside everything else. Literature/practice review.
Reading & Writing time 

add Zotero link to be shared 

Look at PhD's for inspiration and keeping bigger picture in mind

can I start tying things into my research questions
