### About PhD-Live

### What it is

- PhD-Live is a public digital garden of my doctoral research, an ongoing, transparent performance of thought.
- It’s part website, part studio, part sketchbook
- A place where thinking comes together, connections emerge, and the process itself becomes the work.

### How it works

The website supports live tracking, session logging, and real-time reflections of my work as the research develops.

Each type of note serves a different role:
- **Notes** – timestamped fragments that capture spontaneous thoughts or actions
- **Sessions** – focused working periods marked by start and end times
- **Posts** – developed reflections or essays, often synthesised from earlier notes
- **Milestones** – project checkpoints and turning points along the PhD journey

These feed into the homepage that continuously updates to show:
- What’s happening live now or today
- The most recent posts and reflections
- An interactive graph showing conceptual links between notes

 Unlike a traditional blog, this site does not present finished work, but instead showcases a ecosystem of evolving thoughts and ideas.

**_This site is a constant work in progress._**

### How it's built

[PhD-Live](https://github.com/mahaliahr/phd-live) is built from my evolving collection of notes, managed locally in Obsidian and published as a living website. [^1]

[^1]: _The system is based on an adapted version of the open-source [Digital Garden Eleventy](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) framework - which transforms a folder of Markdown notes into a browsable, interlinked network of ideas._

### Why it exists

This website forms part of my practice-based PhD at the Creative Computing Institute, UAL.

My research explores how generative AI is transforming learning and teaching and uses speculative design and imagination as a method to create new ways to engage with these systems. 

By designing this platform, I am exploring what it means to make research processes visible. Inspired by my practice as a live coder, I was wondering what it might look like if you could "live code" a PhD. I believe in this new era of learning, which is greatly shifted by the impacts of generative AI - **process becomes everything**.

This site therefore functions both as a tool and as a case study within my broader inquiry.

<!-- Rather than presenting a polished outcome, [[PhD-Live]] foregrounds the process of becoming
- how ideas unfold, cross-pollinate, and sometimes fall apart.
- capturing the learning process as archive and performance - an experimental rehearsal for what scholarship might look like when it becomes live, networked, and entangled with AI. -->
