Originally a system of notes on index cards in boxes, Zettelkasten is a method of knowledge management conceived by sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

The Zettelkasten system is not just a method of note-taking, but a way of thinking through connections between ideas. Centrally, it involves creating short, focused ('atomic') notes and linking them together into a growing web of thought. Over time, patterns and clusters emerge, making the system a useful way to generate new insights and develop ideas.
