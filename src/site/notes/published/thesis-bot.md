### Project Description: 

This project is in collaboration with the course leader on the MSc Creative Computing. We have worked with a researcher to build a specialised Large Language Model that is trained with specific knowledge of research methods and the thesis process of postgraduate courses at CCI. The hope is that students are able to use this as the first place for questions about deadlines, expectations etc. But also as a way to help them with their ideation phases all the way through to structuring research and writing their papers. In particular, we hope that the tool will help students who have English as a Second Language who are sometimes uncomfortable or reluctant to meet and talk with their supervisors in person.

We have a two prototype with two interfaces working: 
1. 'thesis-assistant' which 'knows' about research methods - trained on course materials that we have shared with the students. It also know key information about deadlines, expectations, staff who are supervisors and information about relevant facilities available to students in the thesis period.
2. 'marking-assistant' this interface has been trained on the marking criteria for the unit and can give very specific guidance and feedback to students on how they are adhering to the unit guidance within their project work.

In order to refine the project further and test it's effectiveness, we would need to conduct user testing from our students.

My next step is to complete an ethics application as soon as possible, so we can move forward with this project in the new year.
