The process of learning and teaching at the same time. How they **simultaneously** work towards my goals (whilst also feeding into each other)

I would be interested to see how that shakes up in other classes - specifically undergraduate classes at CCI. Perhaps this can be asked in [[project-cci-ual-staff-interviews]]
