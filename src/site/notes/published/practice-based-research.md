I feel that I need to keep coming back to earlier thoughts I was having about [[what-kind-of-research-I-want-to-undertake]] to ensure that I keep the intended spirit of the research alive, whilst defining and solidifying things further. 

Critically I believe that my practice will take the form of [[design-interventions]], choreography of activity through workshops, performance(?) and through my teaching. I will use [[research-methods]] that will align with this.

How I am currently (2/4/25) envisioning my PhD research

**Experiments in my teaching & learning

learning experiments - 
	'supervisor-bot' [[project-supervisor-bot]]
	'live-coding a phd' focus on process

[[teaching]] experiments - 
	'diy-bot' framework [[diy-bot-creation]] 
	AI literacy workshops 

other ideas, not yet very defined: 
-> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">speculative prompts</mark> (visual and more?)
-> to imagine other scenarios 
**participatory speculation workshop

these will be informed by tangible aspects such as **environmental issues, political and economic** factors

I will follow threads from here - informed by this idea of [[possibility-spaces-and-impossibility-spaces]] as the [[overarching-research-narrative]]

work towards a September Deadline to have something ready to show the new cohort / bring to conferences

~~find communities outside of UAL and Academia (Immediately coming to mind is Huddlecraft)~~
for now just concentrating on UAL
