Now that we are in a time where generative AI can produce 'results' with 'ease'. The **process** of what we do becomes much more important. 

This is something that I am thinking about a lot and I believe will be an important element within the research.

### **Capturing Process**

Two concepts that I have come across in me research so far are, that center around a showcasing of process are: 

1. [[digital-gardens]]

a digital garden is a publicly accessible, evolving space for personal knowledge—not a polished blog nor a stream of social-posts. It emphasises continuous growth and learning in public, where links between ideas matter more than linear build up of posts over time. Notes are draft-like, imperfect, interconnected, and self-owned rather than locked into social platforms. [[appleton-2020-brief-history-of-digital-gardens]]

2. [[zettelkasten]]

A Zettelkasten Method is a system of note-taking and thinking in which each note ('Zettel') has a unique address, contains a single idea or concept, and links (or references) other notes. This means the collection isn’t just a linear archive, but a web of thoughts, where each note connects to others via addresses and references, enabling non-linear navigation and emergent insight. [[sascha-2020-intro-to-zettelkasten]]

Additionally, as part of [[my-practice]], I am also a live-coder. Live coding as a practice is very much about the practice of sharing your process as it is forming. This led me to think about the idea - what if I could 'live code my PhD' - how and what would that look like?

~~thought: perhaps collecting all of the places that I am developing work, like my github, obsidian, notion, youtube(?) and creating a platform that this is being shared on. Or perhaps doing broadcasts or something? Need further thought, but I am really interested in exploring this.~~

### **Developing a platform**

I have started to develop a platform here -> <www.phd.mm-hr.com> called '[[PhD-Live]]'. This will act as a central hub tracking my work and progress, showcasing the journey and process of my learning throughout the PhD. As generative AI increasingly allows shortcuts learning and in creating works, I feel that the process of making and learning becomes more important and valuable in this context - it's a way to demonstrate your journey and showcase learning in 'real-time'. 

I am using this online space as the beginning of this exploration. 

This platform represents a deliberate effort to demystify the PhD process - by sharing my journey openly, I hope to share the often opaque nature of the PhD process. 

Historically, PhDs have been accessible primarily to a privileged few. This fact motivates my commitment to making my research process open and accessible, with the hope that the insights gained within academia, are relevant to a wider audience - I hope this space will be a place for anyone curious about the research process.

I have scaffolded a system that works between my local obsidian system and the site the builds and displays all of this. More details here: [[phd-live-about-page]]
