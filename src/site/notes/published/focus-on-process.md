Now that we are in a time where generative AI can produce 'results' with 'ease'. The **process** of what we do becomes much more important. 

This is something that I am thinking about a lot and I believe will be an important element within the research.

Two concepts that I have come across in me research so far are, that center around a showcasing of process are: 

1. [[digital-gardens]]

2. [[zettelkasten]]

Additionally, as part of [[my-practice]], I am also a live-coder. Live coding as a practice is very much about the practice of sharing your progress. This has led me to think about the idea - what if I 'live code my PhD' - what would that look like?

~~perhaps collecting all of the places that I am developing work, like my github, obsidian, notion, youtube(?) and creating a platform that this is being shared on. Or perhaps doing broadcasts or something? Need further thought, but I am really interested in exploring this.~~

I have started to develop a platform here -> <www.phd.mm-hr.com> called '[[PhD-Live]]'. This will act as a central hub tracking my work and progress, showcasing the journey and process of my learning throughout the PhD. As gernerative AI increagingly allows shortcuts learning and in creating works, I feel that the process of making and learning becomes more important and valuable in this context - it's a way to demonstrate your journey and showcase learning in 'real-time'. 

I am using this online space as the beginning of this exploration. 

This platform represents a deliberate effort to demystify the PhD process - by sharing my journey openly, I hope to share the often opaque nature of the PhD process. 

Historically, PhDs have been accessible primarily to a privileged few. This fact motivates my commitment to making my research process open and accessible, with the hope that the insights gained within academia, are relevant to a wider audience - I hope this space will be a place for anyone curious about the research process.

I have scaffolded a system that works between my local obsidian system and the site the builds and displays all of this. [[phd-live-about-page]]
