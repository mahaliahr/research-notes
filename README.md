# PhD-Live

PhD-Live is a process-based research website that publishes my PhD work as it unfolds.

Rather than presenting only finished outputs, the site exposes notes, sessions, reflections, and connections in (near) real time. Writing happens locally in Obsidian and is published automatically as a living digital garden.

This project explores what it means to treat research as an ongoing practice rather than a fixed product, within the wider context of my research into generative AI and learning, speculative methods, and creative computation.

## How the site works (briefly)

- Notes are written locally in Obsidian.
- Links between notes form a growing knowledge graph.
- Lightweight syntax is used to track sessions, milestones, and live activity.
- The website updates automatically to reflect recent work, connections, and progress.

Everything here should be read as provisional. Notes may be incomplete, contradictory, or revised over time.

## Background

This site is built on the principles of digital gardening and process publishing, and is technically based on the open-source Digital Garden ecosystem:
https://dg-docs.ole.dev/

## Status

This project is a work in progress. Structure, content, and tooling will continue to evolve throughout the PhD.
